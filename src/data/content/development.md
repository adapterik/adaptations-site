# Development

Over the course of my career, sometimes under the Adaptations banner, have been web 
sites and services based on Java, Tcl, PHP, Common Lisp, Python, Typescript/Javascript,
React, IBM DB2, MongoDb. I've probably forgotten a few.
 
Now, I've settled on a few *key technologies* - Ruby, Docker, layered on top of the existing "web os"
of http, javascript, css, and whatever else web browsers support. 

In other words, we mold the clay of http and html into _something_ to be brought to life in
an http client (web browser). We choose the tools for that artistic process, we recognize
it as an act of creation. 

It could be argued that some arts are purely creative and serve no utility, others more pragmatic
and serve a useful function. A painting, a musical piece, a chair, a knife, a car.

We might even divide these into art, craft, construction, engineering. With varying degrees of originality, individuality.


 
Oh, I'm tempted to opine about what I'm inspired to build. I may at that. 

Or, why I prefer to work the way I do. I simply don't know "why".
