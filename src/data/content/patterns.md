# Patterns

When I began web development, back in the mid ninteties, the dawn of the web,
there was so much promise,  yet so many barriers to fulfilling them.
  
The concept of hypermedia had been around for a while. Degraded by un-refreshed memory, it 
is difficult to remember the specifics of hypermedia tools of the time, when they arose,
whn they fell. HyperCard certainly rises above the rest, for me at least. It has remained as a vision of the unfulfilled  promise, to this day.

Working in the field of web development, it has been easy to lose the vision, the ideal, of 
the interconnected web of information and works. It has become dominated by technological progress, driven by commerce, one way or the other. And it has been difficult, for me at least, employed in that field, to do anything but follow those trends. 
  
It has also been easy to silo the web into commercial and non-commercial. Look, there is wikipedia and there is archive.org, so we are no longer responsible for the free flow of and preservation of information.  We are free to exploit the web infrastructure for commercial interests. 
  
Not that, at the beginning, it was anything but commercial. Before the "free internet", there were all the commercial dial-up services (AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy, ...). In comparison, they seemed limited, exepensive, restrictive. They were not the tabula rasa of the virgin web.
